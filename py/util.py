    Converts a Shapely MultiPolygon to a Shapely Polygon
    For multipart polygons, will only keep the largest polygon

    Note: can also do this via PostGIS query... see myqueries_merit.py, query19a and query19b
          Not sure one approach is better than the other. They both seem to work well.
