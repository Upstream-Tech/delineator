"""
Step #3, Eliminate small "junction nodes."

The decision rule here is that the unit catchment area is small, and river reach length is short.

If that is the case, we will eliminate the node, and reconnect the graph edges as appropriate.

Afterwards, we will also make an effort to update the rivers centerline vertices, just for appearances.

The criteria for a "minor junction" that can be collapsed is:
1. Cannot be a terminal coastal catchment: nextdown !=0
2. The distance between the ends of the polyline are less than a threshold.
  (We can use the `lenghtkm` attribute -- it is close enough.)
3. It should have one or more upstream connections: numup > 0

TODO: Search for junctions that are in series, as these can cause errors. Need to look for 2, 3, 4 in a row.
  Just go recursive.

TODO: Often needs to be run multiple times because on the first pass, it is not able to handle the situation where
  there are multiple little junctions in series.
